  NextJs
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2019-11-28</strong></p>
<p>NextJs is a framework of react js which provides additonal features like routing and solves other problmes like bundling and tooling for the application.
NextJs is an declerative way to make application.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisite-for-the-nextjs-is-follows">Prerequisite for the NextJs is follows:</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>what is Synchrous and Asynchronous.</li>
<li>Async/await function.</li>
<li>Arrow Functions.</li>
<li>Basics of React (Components,Props,State).</li>
<li>Mapping or methods of iterating throug array.</li>
<li>How the browser works.
(Whenever user visits a site it requests a page which is html the server respond this request and send the html page the browser converts this html page into the DOM(it s a representation of the html into a hiearchial tree).The DOM acts as a bridge between the user interface and the your code).</li>
<li>'Thinking in React' part of the offical documentation of React is pretty good to go through.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-things">New Things</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Bundling. -- resolves file dependecies and merge packages.</li>
<li>code splitting. -- splits the applications bundle into smaller chunks for each routes /post/pre-redering so it will split the code for 'post'and 'pre-rendering'so only that particular part is getting renderd when we go to that URL.</li>
<li>minifying. -- In our code we have lots of unecesarry code e.g. comments, indents, spaces.So minifying remove those and reduces the file size to improve the performance.</li>
<li>compiling. -- Whenever we go from build to production enviroment compiling happens in NExt.js.It converts the code from one language to another language.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="api-routes">API Routes</h3>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>to creat a API Routes create a directory in '/pages/api/hello.js', 'hello.js' contains the API endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rendering">Rendering</h3>
<ol>
<li>Client-Side Rendering</li>
<li>Pre-rendering
<ul>
<li>Server-sider rendering -- HTML is generated on each requests.</li>
<li>Static Generation -- happens at build time generates HTML. The pre-generated HTML is reused for every requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<table><thead><tr><th>Sever-Sider Rendering</th><th>Static Generation</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Slow</td><td>Fast</td></tr>
<tr><td>on every request the HTML is generated</td><td>happens at build time and HTML generated is reused for every requests</td></tr>
<tr><td>Should be used when the data is changing constantly</td><td>otherwise use this.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2 id="directory-name-must-be-in-lowercase"><strong>directory name must be in lowercase</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>top level directory</strong></li>
<li>pages directory -- It is in top level directory for individual pages route for each page will be like /post/ssr- if we have ssr- inside a post directory.</li>
<li>components directory -- global components</li>
<li>styles directory --It is a top level directory . It contains files for global css and normal css.</li>
<li>lib directory -- It is a top level directory .It contains files for fetching data</li>
<li>_app.js -- It is in pages/api/ .It is a special type of file which we can use to import global styles.</li>
<li>component level sytles can be achieve by using CSS moudules i.e. util.moudles.css in the components directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lib-posts-js">** lib/posts.js **</h2>
<p>-lib directory i have created an posts.js which does the fetching of the data from the file system.We can also fetch the data from the external API and data fetching fromm the database</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I will explain what have i done in the posts.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have imported 'fs', 'path', 'gray-matter' , 'remark' function from remark and 'html' from 'remark-html'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fs -- deals with the file systems like writing and reading of the files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>path -- helps with the getting the path of the directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gray-matter -- Is used for parasing the metadata of the markdown files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>html form 'remark-html' -- convert the markdown file into HTML string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd().&quot;posts&quot;);
In the above code i have got the path of the posts directory by using the path module <code>porcess.cwd(),'posts</code> get the current working directory .&quot;posts&quot; means look for the posts directory and we will have path /nextjs-blog/posts/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>export function getSortedPostsData()</code>
this function is for reading the contents of the file and returning it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>const fileNames=fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)</code> -- it will read synchornously the contents of the directory i.e all the files and return the array of the file names or directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
